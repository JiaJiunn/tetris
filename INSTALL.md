Our system relies on a few libraries. To run the game, you would need to have 
Ocaml graphics and csv installed, which you can do by typing in the terminal
```
opam install graphics
```
```
opam install csv
```
To run the game, enter the directory containing the release code and run
```
make play
```
In addition, you can also run
```
make
```
which will open the toplevel for any testing you might want to do. Furthermore, 
running
```
make build
```
will build all the source files linked.
